### Project made with Python, Pandas, Plotly

- CHF.csv - file downloaded from a bank containing history of CHF rates
- historia-kredytu-2008.csv - file downloaded from a bank containing history of credit payments

1. Using Pandas we clean and organize data withdrawn from both files.
2. Using Plotly we create the plot of cumulative payments and value of the credit left to pay.
